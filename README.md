# Creating-A-BMP-Programatically

I set about spending an afternoon creating a simple program that would output a Bitmap file, arguably the easiest image format to understand. I limited the bit depth to be a fixed 24 bits, so each pixel could be represented in three bytes. 

You can download a release build, which allows you to create an image of any size with a gradient of any two colours horizontally or vertically, and save it to disk.
